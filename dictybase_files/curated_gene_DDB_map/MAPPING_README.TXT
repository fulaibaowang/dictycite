The columns are as follows:

1. Gene name
2. Prediction Identifier
3. Curated Model Identifier
4. Date Curated Model was created

If there are multiple curated models per gene, this implies a splice variant.
If there are multple predictions per gene, this implies a gene that was incorrectly
predicted as two genes instead of one.  The two predictions have been merged
into one curated model.

The list is ordered, with the most recently Created Curated Models at the 
top and descending.
